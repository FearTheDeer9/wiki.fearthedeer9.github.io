# Topological Space

A topological space $(X, \mathbb{F})$ is a set $X$ and a collection $\mathbb{F}$ of subsets of $X$ such that $\mathbb{F}$ satisfies:

1. $\emptyset \in \mathbb{F}, X \in \mathbb{F}$
2. The union of any members of $\mathbb{F}$ is a member of $\mathbb{F}$
3. The intersection of finitely many members of $\mathbb{F}$ is a member of $\mathbb{F}$.

The set $\mathbb{F}$ is called a topology for $X$.
